Dimensionality Reduction is one of the important techniques in Machine Learning. Feature vectors and the number of data points in real-world problems can have very high dimensions. If we store and compute directly on such high-dimensional data, we will face many difficulties. Therefore, reducing the dimensionality of data is an important step in many problems. It is also considered a method of data compression.<br /> 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in face recognition is a commonly used method for dimensionality reduction, which helps extract important features for classification or facial recognition. In face recognition, PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The main idea of PCA in this context is to reduce the number of features of facial images in a high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while still preserving the most important information <br />

In this project, we provide a face recognition tool. Based on an original image previously provided by the user and stored in the database, the system will analyze and extract facial feature data. When the user faces the camera, the system will identify who the person is and indicate the recognition accuracy as a percentage
